hello beijing
reform and opening up to the outside world have brought about great changes in beijing  
a city with a history  the city has taken on a completely new look as it enters the new century 
 it will embrace the athletes and friends from the rest of the world attending the olympic games with great enthusiasm 
do not go gentle into that good night 
old age should burn and rave at close of day 
rage  rage against the dying of the light
